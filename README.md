## Detailed Project Description
This is a program that takes an image of a luxury watch and can predict the watch's brand and the price in the online watch market. It can identify and predict the price of 15 of the world's most popular luxury watch brands. This is done by training two neural networks with data scraped from chrono24.com.

## Project Layout

Run `tree watch_watcher/ -A -L x` in the directory above the project to get the project layout where `-L` is the directory level to go down. An example: 
```
watch_watcher/
├── data
├── watch_watcher.py
├── notebooks
├── Pipfile
├── plots
├── README.md
└── results
```

Add notes for files and directories to keep track of what they contain:
 - `scraper.py`: Script used for scraping the data from chrono24.com.
 - `data`: Directory where the data is stored.
 - etc.
